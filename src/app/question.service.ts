        "You hear rebels from the direction of your village. What do you do?", 
        "You escape into the woods and begin wondering. Food is running out and you are swallowed by hunger. On the left, you see a coconut tree that is too high for you to climb; on your right, there is a main road. Which way do you go?",
        "Miraculously, you manage to climb the tree. While your friends and you enjoy the coconuts, a local villager captures you. He is convinced that you and your friends are rebel soldiers looting the area. Which object do you present to convince him that you are not a rebel?",
        "The village leader lets you go and provides you with some necessities. You meet your former neighbour on a road. To your excitement, he knows where your  parents are and agree to take you there. When you are almost there, you see that rebels have invaded the village. What do you do?",
        "After the rebels leave, you enter the city only to find that your parents have been killed. You mourn but have no choice but to move onto the next village. Unfortunately, rebels have taken over that village and asks you if you want to become a soldier. What do you say?",
        "After becoming proficient in shooting, you enter your first village-looting mission. While ravaging through villagers' possession, a child appear on the street. The commander orders you to shoot him. What do you to?",
        "After two years being in the rebel army, you get sent on a bus that landed in a rehabilitation centre in Freetown. You began having nightmares about drug-induced killing sprees. Just as you begin to move past that chapter of your life, you receive and invitation to travel to the US to recount your story. Do you accept it?",
        "After the interview, you return to Sierra Leone to live with your remaining family in Freetown. A few weeks later, rebels take over Freetown and life inside the city becomes extremely dangerous. What do you do?",
        "You hear from your previous interviewer who invites you to go live with her family in the US.  You manage to escape from the rebels to get on a bus to Guinea, where the flight will take off. On the border, the bus gets checked by an official who announces that all those who don't have the necessary documents must now reveal themselves. If you do, you get to stay here; if you get caught, you will get sent back to Freetown where rebels have taken over. What do you do?"

      [
        "You see a soldier standing at the entrance of the village, staring directly at you. He orders you to go towards him. Do you obey or run away?",
        "He ties you up and proceeds to kill your neighbours one by one. After shooting your little cousin in front of you, he asks if you like what you see. What do you say?",
        "He nods in satisfaction and tells you to help out with the girls in the rebel camp. A few days later, you see an opportunity to escape and decide to take it. Just as you are about to escape, a soldier spots you and orders you to stop. What do you do?",
        "A boy soldier about your age uses a machete to cut off both your hands and left you to die on the ground. You wake up hungry, weak, and most importantly, lost as to where the hospital is. After a few hours of walking, you see a man in uniform nearby. What do you do?",
        "Luckily, he is not a rebel. You receive direction to the nearest hospital and proceed towards that direction. When you ask for assistance at a village near the hospital, two women harshly tells you to get lost, thinking you are rebels' bait. What do you do?",
        "You faint and wake up to the two women helping you towards the hospital. After medical treatment, you get sent to the amputees' camp in Freetown. You soon learn that you are pregnant with a child of a rapist. You hate the unborn child but the only abortion option is extremely unsafe. What do you do?",
        "The food portion decreases again after you give birth. Both you and your baby are starving. When your uncle brings over the last portion of rice, who should eat it?",
        "Your child dies of malnutrition a few days later which becomes a permanent trauma. Some children in the amputees' camp began begging for additional money but you find it distasteful. Do you join them?",
        "While begging, you meet a news reporter who provides you with an opportunity to travel to Canada. You think your friend may be more qualified for the requirements. Do you tell her?"
